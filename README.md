# Building a Computer from Scratch: A Logisim-Based Project

## About
This project is a guide to build an 8-bit computer from scratch, ideal for learners of computer architecture. It simplifies complex concepts into clear components using **Logisim 2.7.1** for a true from-scratch build. Based on *But How Does It Know?* by J. Clark Scott, it provides the foundation for understanding computer operations. Repository: [https://github.com/hossamIII/But-How-Do-it-Know--logisim-version-.git](https://github.com/hossamIII/But-How-Do-it-Know--logisim-version-.git).


## Roadmap
Follow this step-by-step guide to build and understand the computer:

1. **First Half of The Computer**:
   - Practice the first half of the computer circuits.

2. **Second Half of The Computer (Until you read about the Clock)**:
   - Continue with the second half, building circuits until you finish the clock.

3. **Read the 'clock PDF' to understand timing**:
   - It visualizes the Timing.
   

4. **Continue with The Second Half of The Computer (Until finish practcing the Stepper)**:



5. **Read 'the brain of the Computer PDF' to understand the coming circuits**:
   - A Breakdown of the most compliacted and important partof our computer the CPU.


6. **Finish up practicing 'The Second part of Computer'**:
   - By the end of these circuits, you will understand what all computers consist of.


 
7. **Read the 'How Can We Use This Computer to Communicate with the Outside World' PDF to understand how the computer we built can be scaled up for daily use.**:
   - A Breakdown of the most compliacted and important partof our computer the CPU.

## How to Use
1. Download and Open circuits in Logisim 2.7.1.
2. Follow the roadmap, referring to the PDFs for guidance.
